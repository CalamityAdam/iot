# Tentative Project Proposal

Before we ask you to pour your heart and soul into crafting a polished,
thorough blueprint for your full-stack project, we want to be doubly sure
that your core idea is strong enough not only to stand on its own, but
to really wow employers. We also want to encourage some variety among
full-stack projects; this helps distinguish graduates from each other and
is good for the class as a whole.

To facilitate this, we're going to have you submit to us your top three
choices of project. You'll do this through a Google form we send to your
email. At most one of your choices can be a project of your own design;
in this case, select "Other" and write a brief outline in the provided
text field (details below). Your other choices should be clones of
projects on the [approved list][clone-link].

## Project Outline

This is required if you're proposing a unique project, but it's a good
exercise even if you're planning a straight, no-frills clone. You should
write a bulleted list of the features you will need to implement for
your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Your MVP list should contain **four key features** for your app. Any additional features should be marked `bonus`. For projects from the approved clones list, please see the [MVP List][mvp-list] document for required features.

Think carefully about this, but don't
spend more than 30 minutes actually writing the outline. The idea is not
to sit down and plan everything out in minute detail. Instead, consider
this a sales pitch. Give us enough detail to show that the project has
merit and that you have a game plan for making it happen.

### Example

#### Project: Twitter Clone

**Summary:** Twitter is a social media app that allows users to
publicly share short 'chirps' (tweets) of text.

0. Users can create, view, and edit chirps
0. Users have a private dashboard of other user's chirps and a public profile view of their own chirps
0. Users can follow other users to filter the chirps on their dashboard
